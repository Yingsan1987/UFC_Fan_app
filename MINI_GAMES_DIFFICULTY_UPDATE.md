# 🔥 Mini-Games Difficulty Update

## Overview
All four mini-games have been made **more challenging** based on user feedback. The changes balance skill requirement with fairness - players can still earn good XP, but must perform better to achieve high scores.

---

## 🥊 1. STRIKING - "Pad Work Combo"

### Difficulty Increases

| Aspect | Before | After | Impact |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| **Sequence Length** | 3-5 moves | 4-7 moves | 📈 Longer sequences to memorize |
| **Display Speed** | 1000ms per move | 800ms per move | ⚡ Faster display, less time to memorize |
| **Repeat Time** | Fixed 5s | Dynamic (6s + length) | ⏱️ Scales with difficulty |
| **Critical Chance** | 10% | 8% | 💎 Rarer bonus opportunities |

### Why It's Harder
- **Longer sequences** mean more to remember (up to 7 moves vs 5)
- **Faster display** gives less time to encode the sequence
- **Dynamic timer** means longer sequences get a bit more time, but still challenging
- **Lower critical rate** makes double XP rarer

### XP Still Achievable
- Perfect = 5 XP (or 10 with critical)
- Good performance = 3 XP
- Minimum effort = 1 XP

## 🤼 2. GRAPPLING - "Takedown Timing"

### Difficulty Increases

| Aspect | Before | After | Impact |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| **Sweet Spot Size** | 40-60% (20% width) | 42-58% (16% width) | 🎯 Smaller target |
| **Marker Speed** | 1.5-3.0 | 2.0-4.0 | ⚡ Faster movement |
| **Perfect Zone** | ±2% from center | ±1.5% from center | 💎 Harder to hit perfect |
| **Excellent Zone** | ±5% from center | ±4% from center | 📐 Tighter timing |
| **Close Tolerance** | ±10% outside | ±8% outside | 🎲 Less forgiveness |

### Why It's Harder
- **20% smaller sweet spot** - harder to hit green zone
- **33% faster maximum speed** - less predictable
- **Stricter perfect requirements** - must be nearly dead center for 5 XP
- **Less forgiveness** for near-misses

### XP Still Achievable
- Perfect center (±1.5%) = 5 XP
- Excellent (±4%) = 4 XP  
- Good (in sweet spot) = 3 XP
- Average over 3 attempts determines final reward

## 🫁 3. STAMINA - "Endurance Runner"

### Difficulty Increases

| Aspect | Before | After | Impact |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| **Duration** | 10 seconds | 12 seconds | ⏱️ Must last longer |
| **Base Drain Rate** | 3/sec | 4/sec | 📉 Faster stamina loss |
| **No-Tap Penalty** | 2x drain after 1000ms | 2.5x drain after 800ms | ⚠️ More punishing delays |
| **Overheat Drain** | 3x drain | 4x drain | 🔥 Harsher overheat penalty |
| **Overheat Threshold** | < 150ms between taps | < 180ms between taps | ⚡ Easier to overheat |
| **Tap Refill** | +8% stamina | +6% stamina | 💧 Less refill per tap |
| **Resistance Range** | 0.8-1.3x | 0.9-1.6x | 💨 Higher variability |

### Why It's Harder
- **20% longer duration** - must maintain rhythm longer
- **33% faster drain** - stamina drops quicker
- **Earlier penalties** - must tap more consistently
- **Overheat more punishing** - harder to recover from mistakes
- **Less refill** - each tap gives less stamina back
- **Higher resistance** - some days are much harder

### Perfect Rhythm Required
Players must find the **optimal tap rhythm** (~200-250ms apart):
- Too slow → stamina drains
- Too fast → overheat triggers
- Just right → maintain high stamina

### XP Still Achievable
- Perfect (70%+ stamina, good efficiency) = 5 XP
- Great (50%+) = 4 XP
- Good (30%+) = 3 XP
- Survival = 1-2 XP

## 🛡️ 4. DEFENSE - "Reflex Block"

### Difficulty Increases

| Aspect | Before | After | Impact |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| **Tap Window** | 800ms | 650ms | ⚡ Much faster reactions needed |
| **Spawn Delay** | 300-800ms | 200-600ms | 🎯 Pads appear faster |
| **Double-Hit Chance** | 15% | 25% | 💥 More simultaneous targets |
| **Lightning Bonus** | < 200ms | < 150ms | ⚡ Stricter perfect timing |
| **Quick Bonus** | < 400ms | < 350ms | 📐 Tighter good timing |
| **Perfect Score** | 30 points | 40 points | 📈 Higher bar |
| **Perfect Accuracy** | 80% | 85% | 🎯 Must be more accurate |
| **Perfect Combo** | 5+ | 6+ | 🔥 Longer streak needed |
| **Great Score** | 20 points | 28 points | 📊 Higher threshold |
| **Great Accuracy** | 70% | 75% | 📈 Less room for error |
| **Good Score** | 15 points | 20 points | 💪 Must block more |
| **Okay Score** | 10 points | 12 points | ✅ Higher minimum |
| **Miss Penalty** | 10+ misses | 8+ misses | ⚠️ Stricter penalty |

### Why It's Harder
- **19% shorter tap window** (650ms vs 800ms) - MUST react faster
- **Faster spawns** - less breathing room between targets
- **67% more double-hits** - more multitasking required
- **All thresholds raised** - must score 33%+ higher for same XP
- **Stricter timing bonuses** - perfect reactions worth more
- **Earlier penalties** - 8 misses hurt instead of 10

### Skill-Based Scoring
This is now the **hardest mini-game**:
- Requires **genuine reflex skills**
- Double-hits test **multi-target awareness**
- Combo system rewards **consistency**
- High scores need **sustained focus**

### XP Still Achievable
- Perfect (40+ score, 85%+ accuracy, 6+ combo) = 5 XP
- Great (28+ score, 75%+ accuracy) = 4 XP
- Good (20+ score) = 3 XP
- Okay (12+ score) = 2 XP
- Participation = 1 XP
